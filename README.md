# Diesel Mocks

Write mocks locally with the full assistance of IDE.
Serve them remotely with ease.

HTTP/REST is supported now, more to come.

## Concept

- IDE-assisted rule editing
- Git-hosted rules
- server code and rules lives in the same git branch
- dynamic responses

## Keep track

- `./mvnw test` finds zero tests
